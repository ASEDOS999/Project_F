# Project_F
It's project for Computer Technology. 
It will be able to recognize formule in the text in scan document and to rewrite them in a TEX-file. 
Probably, text that isn't formul–∞ will be recognized by this programm.

Proposed stages of programm's work:
1. filtration - elimination of noise.
2. Segmention of text - process when all "images" formulas will be found.
3. Segmentation of formula. One proposes that formula will be devided into sub-formula recurrently while sub-formula isn't one string(viz. it isn't fraction, exponent, etc.)
4. Segmentation of sub-formula - deviding string into symbols.
5. Recognition. This stage will be implemented by one of standard ways for Recognition of text. It may be metric method.
